        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Cybersecurity is defined as the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks typically aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, or disrupt normal business processes.</p>
        <br>
        <p><Strong>Importance of Cybersecurity:</Strong></p>   
        <ul>
            <li>Protecting Personal and Financial Data: Ensuring that sensitive personal and financial information is secure.</li>
            <li>Securing Critical Infrastructure: Protecting essential services such as power grids and hospitals from cyber threats.</li>
            <li>Preventing Economic Damage: Mitigating the financial impact of cybercrime on businesses and individuals.</li>
